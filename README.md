Project Name - Employee Management System (EMS).

Project description - The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Java-based console application designed to streamline employee data management through a simple, menu-driven interface. It implements core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation and modularity, offering essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee records. The system uses file-based storage for easy portability and maintainability, making it ideal for small to medium-scale organizations. With a clean class structure separating the data model, file management, and user interaction, EMS serves as a practical application of OOP in real-world software development.
