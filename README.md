                  🧑‍💼 Employee Management System (EMS) --:

📋 Project Description:
      
   Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS) — a simple yet powerful Java console application designed to streamline employee record management for small and medium businesses.
   This project focuses on providing a robust, user-friendly, and efficient way to handle everyday employee operations such as adding new employees, viewing details, updating 
   records, and removing employees, all through an intuitive command-line interface.


Why EMS?

Because managing employee data should be easy, error-free, and maintainable — without heavy databases or complicated setups.
